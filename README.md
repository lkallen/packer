# Packer Hacker

## Live Project

https://packerhacker.vercel.app/


## Overview

This project was developed to help users create lists and ensure packing of all items needed when traveling. Users can create and edit lists by category and can then use these lists to mark items as 'packed' when planning/packing for trips. Users can also reset all items to 'unpacked' in order to start a new trip. Note: currently, all users are considered 'guests' and can only edit or delete items from the 'guest' category.
