# Packer Hacker

## Live Project

https://packerhacker.vercel.app/

## Overview

This project was developed to help users create lists and ensure packing of all items needed when traveling. Users can create and edit lists by category (guest users can only edit or delete from the 'guest' category) and can then use these lists to mark items as 'packed' when planning/packing for trips. Users can also reset all items to 'unpacked' in order to start a new trip.
